Practical notebooks for the SciML workshop

## STFC Cloud
### Directions for setup

* Go to the workshop Jupyter lab server http://130.246.214.99/
* Login with your STFC Federal ID and password.
* Leave the `notebook type` and `resources` options set as default.
* Click start
* Wait for 2-3 minutes for your virtual machine to start
   * Note: Be patient. This takes several minutes, but you should only have to do this once for the duration of the workshop. 
* Once started your VM will be available at `http://130.246.214.99/user/{your-fed-id}/lab?` for the duration of the workshop.
